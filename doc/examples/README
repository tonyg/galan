This directory contains simple examples of gAlan in action. To try them out,
load the *.galan files using the File/Open menu.

Some of the examples require samples to be assigned to the
sample-players in the gAlan file: find all the "sampled voice"
components (labeled voice1, voice2, ... or similar) and choose the
"Properties..." option from their popup-menus. Select the sample file
that you want that sample-player to play.

Other examples may be found via the master website (see the README in
the main distribution directory for the URL).

Cheers,
  Tony
