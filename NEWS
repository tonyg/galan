1 August 1999: Project started.

19 August 1999: Almost ready for first release...
	* playback works fine
	* simple sequencing etc works fine
	* save/load seems to work
	* still need to document system

30 August 1999: Some problems have come to light with treatment of time in
	the program - still thinking about how best to resolve them.

3 September 1999: First port to Win32! It runs, plugins load, but I haven't
	implemented sound output yet.

14 September 1999: Finished switching file formats to the (much
	better) text-based one. Next job is to move to Steve Hoek's
	suggestion for dealing with realtime in a more flexible
	manner...

16 September 1999: Finished the new master-clock code. This should allow
	various kinds of plugin that weren't possible/easy before.
	Getting close to release.

18 September 1999: Sound works on Win32. It's patchy, there are major
	problems, the latency it enormous... but it works.
	Today is release day.

22 October 1999: After about a day of fighting libtool/automake I've come to
	the conclusion that that particular combination bites hard.
	<sigh>. Oh well, at least I tried...
