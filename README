This is gAlan, an audio-processing program for X-windows (or platforms
that support GTK+). gAlan is distributed under the GNU General Public
License - for more information please see the COPYING file in this
directory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: As a special exception, gAlan plugins are *not* required to be
licensed under the GPL. The writer gets to choose a license for each
plugin he/she writes. So if any third party vendor wants to distribute
a plugin for gAlan with a different license, that's fine - and if
they're a little touchy about their source-code, they're welcome to
distribute the plugin as a binary only.

However, please do consider releasing your plugin under the GPL. Each
such open-sourced plugin makes the whole project just that little bit
stronger.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please see the INSTALL file for installation instructions - it should
be sufficient to type

	$ ./configure
	$ make
		(and then as root)
	# make install

You will need GTK+ v2.x and a properly-configured OSS/ALSA compatible soundcard
capable of 44.1kHz 16-bit stereo output. A fast CPU is also recommended.

the gAlan 0.3 branch is jackified and autodetects a jack installation.

gAlan tries to autodetect various libraries and builds plugins for these:

- jack
- alsa
- libsndfile
- gtkglarea (seems to be working in 0.3)
- libvorbis
- liblrdf
- fst (windows vst plugins)

if you have an SB Live you can try ./configure --enable-emu10k1
which should build the emu components.

with these you can route signals in the DSP...
