M - V - C

Models:
	- Generator (GeneratorClass)

Views:
	- Component (ComponentClass)
	- Control (ControlDescriptor)

Controllers:
	- implicit...?
	- it'd probably be cleaner with a formal separation.
	- will probably need some kind of Controller-style mechanism
	  to implement feedback from Generator's data to visible controls...
